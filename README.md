# BMI Calculator in Flutter

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator developed using Flutter. It is an example project designed for beginners to learn Flutter and understand how to build a basic mobile application.

The BMI calculator takes input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) and calculates the BMI value. It then provides a brief description of the user's body weight status, whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, based on the calculated BMI value.

## Features
